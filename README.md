# Data Structure Design Template

This template is designed to allow you to quickly get up and going designing data structures in Javascript and interacting with them in the web console in real-time.

## Set up

Install git dependencies and use `npm start` to serve the files on localhost

## Usage

The files in the /src folder are your data structure files. You may add additional class files to the folder. Remember to also add a reference to the file in the .html file using this syntax:
`<script src="./className.js"></script>`

Once the server is started, you are able to make changes to the files and reload the browser only to see the changes. You may interact with the data in memory within the browser console window.
